Holo-Morph, 3:15
I chose to do a Holo-Morph inspired design. Using crystal-like images and a lighter color scheme. The design insperation from the video had more darker backgrounds, but I didn't like how that looked.

Holograms and crystals are two fascinating areas of study that have captivated the scientific community and the general public alike. Both fields offer new and innovative ways of looking at the world around us, as well as the potential to transform our lives in unexpected ways. In this paper, we will explore these two topics and analyze their importance in the modern world.

Holograms are 3D images produced from the interference pattern of two or more coherent light sources. They have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to create realistic and immersive visual experiences. Holographic displays are already widely used in medical, military, and entertainment industries, and their potential applications in fields such as education and gaming are still being explored.

The underlying science behind holography is complex but fascinating. The image produced by a hologram appears to be three-dimensional, but it is actually a two-dimensional surface that is recorded onto a photosensitive material. The interference patterns that produce the hologram are created by wave fronts generated by a laser split into two beams. One beam is directed onto the object, while the other beam is directed onto the photosensitive material. The two beams interact, causing the beams to interfere with one another, and the resulting pattern is recorded on the photosensitive material.

Holograms are not only visually stunning, but they also have practical uses. For example, they can be used for security purposes, such as in credit cards that incorporate a holographic image to prevent fraud. Holograms can also be used in art, as seen in the works of well-known holography artist, Harriet Casdin-Silver, who uses the medium to create dazzling light sculptures that play with space and perception.

Another area of study that is closely related to holography is crystallography, which involves the study of the structure and properties of crystals. Crystals are defined as solid materials whose atoms or molecules are arranged in a highly ordered, repetitive pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions. Crystals have numerous real-world applications, including in electronics, medicine, and engineering.

One of the most well-known applications of crystals is in the creation of silicon chips, which are used to power electronic devices. The properties of crystals, such as their electrical conductivity and optical properties, make them ideal for use in microelectronics. Similarly, crystals are used in medical applications, such as in the creation of medical devices and drug formulations.

Crystallography is also useful in understanding how materials behave and interact with each other. The ability to visualize the atomic structure of a crystal can provide important insights into physical and chemical properties of the material, such as its hardness, melting point, and conductivity.

In conclusion, holography and crystallography are two highly specialized but interconnected fields of study that have tremendous potential for further discovery and innovation. Both offer unique ways of looking at the world around us and can be applied in numerous industries to improve our lives. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in these fields.
